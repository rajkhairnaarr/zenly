## 7. Performance Requirements
Zenly is developed using a modern tech stack to ensure optimal performance, scalability, and maintainability:

### 7.1 Frontend Technologies
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with component-based architecture. React provides a responsive and dynamic user experience through its virtual DOM implementation, which optimizes rendering performance. The component structure also facilitates code reusability and maintenance.

- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and other performance optimizations. Next.js provides improved SEO capabilities, faster page loads, and better user experience through features like automatic code splitting.

- **CSS/SCSS**: For styling components with a modular approach, ensuring visual consistency throughout the application while maintaining flexibility for responsive design across devices.

### 7.2 Backend Technologies
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing for an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient for data-intensive real-time applications. Node.js enables a unified JavaScript ecosystem across client and server.

- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Express facilitates the creation of RESTful APIs for serving meditation content and handling user authentication.

- **MongoDB**: A document-oriented NoSQL database used for storing user data, meditation content metadata, and application configuration. MongoDB's flexible schema design aligns well with the evolving nature of the application's data requirements.

### 7.3 Performance Metrics
- Page load time: < 2 seconds on standard broadband connections
- API response time: < 200ms for standard requests
- Concurrent user capacity: Support for 10,000+ simultaneous users
- Audio streaming: Buffer-free playback on 4G/WiFi connections
